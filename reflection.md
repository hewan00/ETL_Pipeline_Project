# Reflection on ETL Pipeline Project

## Challenges Faced
During the implementation of the ETL pipeline, one of the major challenges was ensuring that the data was fetched correctly from the API. I had to troubleshoot 
several errors related to network issues and API response formats. Additionally, understanding how to transform JSON data into a structured CSV format required 
careful handling of nested data structures. It also made it harder for me to learn a majority of the things through lectures posted insted of being abel to be 
in class and ask questions/enagge with classmates and students. 

## Easier Than Expected
I found the process of using the Pandas library for data manipulation to be surprisingly straightforward. The ability to easily convert between data
formats and to load data into a SQLite database made the coding process smoother than I initially anticipated. The documentation 
provided by Pandas was particularly helpful in understanding the functions available for data transformation.

## Harder Than Expected
While loading data into SQLite was mostly seamless, I encountered some difficulties with ensuring that the data types were correctly inferred
from the CSV file. I had to spend extra time refining the data loading process to ensure that all columns were accurately represented in the database. And 
additionally I had a lot of trouble uploading the data base into git hub and wasn't quite sure how to upload them in way that was visable and able to integrated
into the code

## Utility of the ETL Pipeline
This utility will be immensely beneficial for future data projects, particularly when dealing with disparate data sources. The ability
to extract data from various formats, transform it for analysis, and load it into a structured format like a database can streamline the
data preparation process significantly. 

## Conclusion
Overall, this project provided a practical introduction to building an ETL pipeline. It highlighted the importance of data preparation in
the data science workflow and the versatility of tools like Python and Pandas in handling different data formats. It also made me get uncomftable with a lot 
of the section I did not understand and forced me to watch tutorials to understand a majority of the projects.
